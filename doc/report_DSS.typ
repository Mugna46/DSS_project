= Introduction
The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the malware using different tools and techniques. The analysis will cover the following aspects:
#v(0.5em)
- Static analysis
- Dynamic analysis

#linebreak()
The main goal was to identify the malicious payload inside the `APK` files of the provided samples.

#linebreak()

== Tools used
During this project, we used three main analysis tools to identity the malicious behavior of the
samples:
#v(0.5em)
- *VirusTotal* (Antimalware Analysis)
  - It's a web tool that allows to submit samples and analyze them  with several antivirus or antimalware programs 
  - This tool was used to gain a starting insight on the already existing knowledge about the specific malicious sample.
  #v(0.5em)
- *MobSF* (Static and Dynamic analysis)
   - This tool let the analyst to automatically highlight interesting features of the
  application (e.g. Android permissions, API calls, remote URLs), but also to extract
  the Java code from the APK file. In this way we can gain a strong insight of the
  potential malicious behavior of the application and then manually analyze it by examining the code.
  - Moreover, it allows to perform a dynamic analysis, by executing the application inside a virtual environment and by monitoring it.
  #v(0.5em)
- *JD-GUI* (Java Decompilation)
  - This tool allows to decompile the Java code extracted from the APK file and to analyze it in a more user-friendly way.
  - It is useful to understand the logic behind the code and to identify potential malicious behavior.
#linebreak()
We found that 4 out of 5 samples belong to the same malware family, *FakeBank*, which consists of `trojans` designed to steal sensitive banking and SMS information. The remaining sample is a `ransomware` disguised under the name of the popular game *Clash Royale*.
